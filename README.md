# AWA1 Project
An IRC web client

## Idea
The idea is to make a web component, this component would be a foldable chat box
people would be presented with a hovering button that once clicked would open a
dragable window (web dragable window, not a separate tab). This window would contain the basic chat features, such as :
- Chat history
- Username controls
- Chat input
- Formatter helper (maybe, it's probably not supported by the IRC protocol)
- Emoji input

Also, this chatbox would persist through page changes, allowing the user to browse the website all the while chatting with people.

### Theme
This web client would follow the visual theme of the following [HEXO theme](https://github.com/Yue-plus/hexo-theme-arknights).

### Backend
For this to work, the client needs to connect to some form of chat room.
This will be handled by an [IRC server](https://www.inspircd.org/). The client
will connect to said IRC through a websocket and will handle the communication with the server.

### Animations
For this project to make sense in the AWA1 module context, this chat,
will make heavy use of animations, svg effects, text effects, and the like.

## Running the project
### Prerequisites
    - An internet connection
    - A php installation
### Running the project
Running this project is very simple, it is a simple static html page.
To do so open a terminal and type the following commands:
```shell
$ cd /path/to/container/folder
$ git clone git@github.com:VivienCPNV/AWA1.git
$ cd AWA1
$ php -S localhost:8080
```
After that visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

```
## Integration
This project only includes the basic html/css/js for this specific
component. You're free to use this repo to integrate this component
on your website. An example of integration was provided in the [releases](https://github.com/VivienCPNV/AWA1/releases/tag/latest).
To run this example, download it, extract it somewhere and run the following commands:
```shell
$ cd /path/to/container/folder
$ php -S localhost:4000
```
After that visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
